**THIS LIABILITY WAIVER (“Waiver”) IS A BINDING LEGAL AGREEMENT** between you (“You” or “Licensee”) and the developers, maintainers, contributors, and affiliated entities (“Licensor”, “We”, “Us”) covering the use of the **Bangladesh Stock Market Forecasting & Anomaly Detection** proof‑of‑concept repository (the “Software”), including all source code, documentation, scripts, data, models, and accompanying materials (collectively, the “Repository”).  By downloading, installing, executing, or otherwise using any portion of the Repository, You accept and agree to be bound by this Waiver.  If You do not agree to all terms in this Waiver, You must immediately cease all use of the Repository and delete all copies in Your possession.

2. You understand and agree that any forecasts, predictions, signals, or outputs of the models contained in the Repository (including but not limited to LSTM, Prophet, and Isolation Forest) are based on **simulated data**.  The Repository’s outputs bear **no direct resemblance** to real market data or actual trading instruments, and any use of those outputs for real‑world trading carries significant risk.  **Under no circumstances** shall You rely exclusively on the Repository for financial decision‑making.

- **CAP ON LIABILITY.**  IF ANY JURISDICTION PROHIBITS THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, THE PROTECTED PARTIES’ LIABILITY SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, AND NOT TO EXCEED THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF FIVE U.S. DOLLARS (US$5.00).

## 4. Indemnification
